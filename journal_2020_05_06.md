# Instructions for Change - Commit - Pull Request & Practice editme.md file.

In order to prepare yourself for the upcoming lit-dit-age project, practicing editing an existing file and uploading it to git will be particularly useful when applying the same techniques to the TEI file. 

Using your GUI, find the practice folder that contains the file labeled: EDITME.md. 

Open that .md file with Visual Studio Code or Oxygen XML Editor (Oxygen might be a better software for editing the TEI file than Visual Studio Code) and edit the document. 

Don't forget to save your changes!

Now, open up a terminal window and enter the following commands: 

cd Documents/lit-dig-age-proj/ (or wherever the file exists)

git status to see the changes/modifications you've made. 

git add "EDITME.md" (or whatever the name of the file is) and hit enter

Then, commit the changes to git by entering the following command: 

git commit -m "brief description/comment about committed file"

Finally, push the changes using the command: 

git push origin master 

In order to double check that your file has been commited, it doesn't hurt to run the command "git status" just to double check that all updates and commits were successful. 

Apply these same commands to the TEI file that you will be editing with your group and don't forget to save your documents before exiting or quiting Visual Studio Code or Oxygen XML Editor
