# I. Shell Scripts: hello_world.sh

1.The first line,_#!/bin/bash_, is like a hand-wave to your operating system, saying "Hey, look at me, I'm a bash script!" 

2.The next line,_mkdir ~/hello_ tells your computer to create a directory (i.e., folder) named hello in your home folder. _(~/ is just useful shorthand for /Users/yourusername where yourusername is your actual username.)_ 

3.The line after that says, "Switch to the folder ~/hello."

4.The one after that says, "Print the text string 'Hello World!' and write it to a new file inside the current directory, naming that file hello_world.txt"

5.The final line says, "Open the file ~/hello/hello_world.txt in VS Code."

6.Access these steps from the following website: _https://github.com/WhatTheDickens/lit-dig-age/blob/master/cli/shell-scripts.md_

# II. Writing Scripts in VC
