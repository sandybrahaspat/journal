### 2. The next line,_mkdir ~/hello_ tells your computer to create a directory (i.e., folder) named hello in your home folder. _(~/ is just useful shorthand for /Users/yourusername where yourusername is your actual username.)_ 
### 3. The line after that says, "Switch to the folder ~/hello."
### 4. The one after that says, "Print the text string 'Hello World!' and write it to a new file inside the current directory, naming that file hello_world.txt"
### 5. The final line says, "Open the file ~/hello/hello_world.txt in VS Code."
