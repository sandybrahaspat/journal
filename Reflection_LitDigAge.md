# End of the Semester Reflection

As my senior year comes to a close, I am glad that I chose to enroll in Dr. Schacht's Digital Humanities course. I've become so much more confident with my own laptop and using the terminal window. While aspects of this course seemed daunting at first, like my irrational fear of making an error in my terminal window and consequently destroying my computer, it all definitely became much more manageable with practice. 

While I've figured out how to utilise digital skills to assist my literary analyses (refer to second blog post), I really enjoyed being able to work extensively with Thoreau's manuscripts. In fact, being able to see his revisions and follow along with his writing process reminded me of my own processes and patterns of revisions. Oftentimes when I write lengthy papers, I go back and cross out large sections that either get cut completely from the final product, or get moved somewhere else (usually they exist in the form of a footnote). Being able to see a physical visualisation of Thoreau's revisions influenced my decision to write my essays by keeping the "track my changes" function on. Doing this enabled me to see exactly what I was striking through, moving, or expanding on in a way unlike I've done before. Truthfully speaking, as a tutor at the WLC I've worked with a number of students who required assitance with evaluating their progress after utilising the "track my changes" function as a part of the INTD105 requirements, but I never really took the time aside to consider my own process by utilising this function. And once I turned it on, I simply refused to turn it off. Sure it looked like a chaotic mess with strikethroughs littering my paper but isn't that the epitome of the writing process? Writing, deleting, staring at the wall for an hour or two, writing again, and then deleting everything to start over? Either way, Thoreau's manuscripts really forced me to evaluate my own writing strategies within the context of the digital humanities and for that I am grateful.
