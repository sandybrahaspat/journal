## Instructions for Syncing Files for Lit-Dig-Age Project

Step by step instructions on how to sync files to repositories - fortunately, this is a one-time deal. 

First, find the repository that you would like to sync. In this case, it's the lit-dig-age-proj repository that the user _WhatTheDickens_' created. 

One the right hand side, you will notice a green tab that reads the following: clone or download. 

Once you've clicked the green tab, be sure to copy the URL. 

Head to the terminal windown and cd into the clone of the lit-dit-age-proj repository you created earlier (for me, it exists in my Documents' folder)

Once you've done that, type the following into the command line: 

$ git remote -v

Once you've hit enter, the following should appear: 

> origin https://github.com/yourusername/lit-dig-age-proj.git (fetch)
> origin https://github.com/yourusername/lit-dig-age-proj.git (push)

Now, type "git remote add upstream" and paste the URL that you copied from WhatTheDickens' repository. 

Hit enter and type git remote -v to verify that you've used the correct repository.
