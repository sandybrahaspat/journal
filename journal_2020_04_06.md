## Things I Learned Today
- Timeline JS 

## Quick Tips for Timeline JS

1. Follow the link of Timeline JS to get a copy of their Google sheet template: https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make

2. When including BCE years, insert a negative value in the "Years" colomn and Timeline JS will automatically convert it into BCE formatting. 

3.  In order to add an image to a specific slide on the timeline, be sure to click the link that takes you directly to the image file:

    For example: using a link like this will take the spreadsheet directly to the image and will show up on a slide https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Berliner_Dom%2C_170409%2C_ako_%282%29.jpg/1024px-Berliner_Dom%2C_170409%2C_ako_%282%29.jpg
