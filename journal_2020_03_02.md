-Terms will indicate where the text appears, how often, and collocates: words that appear alongside the particular word. In addition to the list of phrases that the word appears in. 

For example, the term "like" in Walden appears the most in Thoreau's _Economy_ (301 times). Or, consider the context in which the term "pond" appears. 

Frequencies indicate how often/where the prevalence of terms exist within the text. 

When clicking on a word in the lower right box (Context, Bubblelines, Correlations) it appears in the reader

In order to find comparisions in one text, type two or more different words into the search box under the _Trends_ graph. The system doesn't offer an explanation, but it will help with gathering evidence that you might need in order to make your own interpretations and analyses.

# Using Grep in the Command Line

    grep is a program you can run on windows/mac

    grep command is essentially a search: searching for _patterns_, individual words, etc. 
    Visit this site for more information on [grep](https://github.com/WhatTheDickens/lit-dig-age/blob/master/text-analysis/grep.md)

    In the command line: $ grep -Eo '\b\w+\b' walden.txt | wc -l 
        "E" = extended regular expressions - a notation that indicates a patter
        w+ = one more alpha numeric characters that have a border on either sides
        o = put each thing on its own line, (take's them out and lists them separately)
    
    In the command line: $ grep -Eo '\b\w+\b' walden.txt | sort -uf | wc -l
        take output from initial command and use it as input of the source command
        Will sort by default alphabetically, etc. 
        -u = find unique 
        f= ignore upper or lower case
    In the command line: $ grep -E --color=always 'read' walden.txt
     highlights every time the word or a portion of the word "read" appers throughout the text.
     
     In the command line: grep -E --color=always '\bread\b' walden.txt
     highlights everytime the word "read" appears.

     In the command line: $ grep -E --color=always '\b(R|r)ead\b|\b(R|r)eaders?\b|\b(R|r)eading\b' walden.txt, highlights every time words like "reader(s)" and "reading" and "Reading."
